                    <blockquote><p>For this app i was put into groups of 3, we used MIT Appinventor its a more
                        <br>user friendly system, as with the last project we had to create a paper prototype
                        <br> for enitial design and preform usability test for it. After we carried out
                        <br> the tests we got some really possative feadback for the app and one of the
                        <br>users who tested it wanted it to be put onto the app market. For this i created
                        <br> the visual side for the app creating the maps and the first person view to
                        <br> help if poeple prefer, there was also on screen instructions for the app which
                        <br> helped anyone who had difficulty using the app. At the end the app worked really
                        <br> well and for the final product users who used it even after the project had finished
                        <br> it was really good and worked as we wanted.</p></blockquote>
