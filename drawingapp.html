                    <blockquote><p>For this project we was put into a group of 4 to create an app for a andirod device,
                        <br>we was asked to make certin features in the app such as a clear button,
                        <br> different colours and to select different brush sizes.We started with
                        <br>a paper prototype with how we wanted the app to look, we did some user
                        <br>testing for this which gave us an idea of what worked and what we had to
                        <br> do. We then started to develop the app in processing making different
                        <br>changes to the design to make it work when using processing, the start
                        <br>of the app every interaction on the app was a button with set colours
                        <br>and we had one standard brush size. however as we had time left over i
                        <br>changed to colours to a slider using an inported libary and making different
                        <br> brush sizes and give the brush a relalistic look to it.</p></blockquote>
