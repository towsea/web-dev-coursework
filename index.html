                    <p>I am currently a student that is going into my final year of Coventry University. But before that I was born and rasied in
                        <br> Beverley which is in the East Riding Of Yorkshire. Before coming to university i studied at New College Pontefract where i
                        <br> found my love for computers. Because of all this I wanted to go on and persue my creare in working with and around the latest
                        <br> technology and then to one day make something that will help change someones life for the better.</p>

                    <h1>University Projects</h1>
                    <p><strong>While at university I have controbuted to many different projects.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Drawing Application</h3>
                    <p>For this project we was put into a group of 4 to create an app for a andirod device,
                        <br>we was asked to make certin features in the app such as a clear button,
                        <br> different colours and to select different brush sizes.We started with
                        <br>a paper prototype with how we wanted the app to look, we did some user
                        <br>testing for this which gave us an idea of what worked and what we had to
                        <br> do. We then started to develop the app in processing making different
                        <br>changes to the design to make it work when using processing, the start
                        <br>of the app every interaction on the app was a button with set colours
                        <br>and we had one standard brush size. however as we had time left over i
                        <br>changed to colours to a slider using an inported libary and making different
                        <br> brush sizes and give the brush a relalistic look to it.</p>

                    <h3>Way Finder App</h3>
                    <p>For this app i was put into groups of 3, we used MIT Appinventor its a more
                        <br>user friendly system, as with the last project we had to create a paper prototype
                        <br> for enitial design and preform usability test for it. After we carried out
                        <br> the tests we got some really possative feadback for the app and one of the
                        <br>users who tested it wanted it to be put onto the app market. For this i created
                        <br> the visual side for the app creating the maps and the first person view to
                        <br> help if poeple prefer, there was also on screen instructions for the app which
                        <br> helped anyone who had difficulty using the app. At the end the app worked really
                        <br> well and for the final product users who used it even after the project had finished
                        <br> it was really good and worked as we wanted.</p>

                    <h3>Python Server Using Raspberry Pi</h3>
                    <p>In this project we was put into groups of 2, we had been set the task to download
                        <br> and retrive files that are on the raspberry pi to load onto the python client
                        <br> such as a word or text document or sound to a video file. Coding this for
                        <br> the project came with a few objects to overcome. To start with we had to first
                        <br> install the rasberry pi with its operating system, and then install an apachi
                        <br> server to allow the python client to connect to the raspberry pi. I then put
                        <br> the files in to a certin file on the raspberry pi. It was then a case of writing
                        <br> the code for the python server to tell it where to go by using variables and then
                        <br> creating a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the user to use.</p>
